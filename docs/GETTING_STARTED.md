# Getting Started

First, install [bos-workspace](https://github.com/sekaiking/bos-workspace)

```bash
npm install -g bos-workspace
```

Next,

bos://devs.near/widget/GithubForkButton

This is now your workspace. To use it, run:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

This will broadcast your widgets.

```bash

| Server running at http://127.0.0.1:4040/

| To use the local widgets, go to https://near.org/flags
| and paste the server link above.

```

Copy this server address, and paste it as the BOS Loader Url [here](https://everything.dev/flags).

Now refresh the page.
